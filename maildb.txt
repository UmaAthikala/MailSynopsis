Hi Uma,	 

 	 Welcome to your new Outlook.com account. Outlook lets you stay connected, organized, and productive—at work, at home, and everywhere in between.	  	 

 	

	Discover a more productive inbox across all your devices 

Managing your busy life shouldn't be difficult. With email and calendar in just one service, Outlook makes it easy for you to stay on top of it all — whether you're catching up on conversations, setting up coffee dates, or organizing a weekend trip. 

 	

	 

Collaborate with ease 

Easily attach files to your messages from OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive, and more, and work together on shared files in real time. 

Connect your storage accounts <https://aka.ms/pc9jwq>  

	

	 

Get more done with integrations 

Connect to your favorite apps and services, including PayPal, Uber, Yelp, and Boomerang. Find a great restaurant, set up a ride, pay your friends, and do so much more without leaving Outlook. 

Add an integration <https://aka.ms/uuzyla>  

	

	 

Keep track of your favorite teams and shows 

Don't miss the best moments of your favorite sports teams or TV shows. With Interesting calendars in Outlook, you can add the schedules from over 300 teams and shows to your Outlook calendar. 

Add an Interesting Calendar <https://aka.ms/o70fs6>  

	

	 

Much more than just email 

Outlook.com automatically connects you to free Microsoft apps and services like OneDrive, Skype, Office Online, OneNote, and more. 

Try Office Online <https://aka.ms/h5p4bv>
